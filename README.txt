This data set is the result of the experiments performed by Matti Niemenmaa as
part of his work on his Master's Thesis.

The available data includes:
- CSVs containing runtime data.
- Dstat logs.
- Impala's per-query profiles, with some slightly mangled summary lines at the
  start introduced by the script used to fetch them.

Only files pertaining to results actually used in the Thesis are available
here.
